# The Mill - Complete Development Documentation

## Session Date: 2025-08-23

## Overview
The Mill is a specialized workspace in CutList that simulates a compound miter saw for practicing and executing precision cuts. It provides a training ground for woodworkers to perfect complex compound miter cuts needed for crown molding, trim work, and finish carpentry.

## Development Journey

### Initial State
- Basic 2D workspace concept
- Simple cutting functionality
- No visual representation of cutting tools

### Current Implementation

#### Core Features Implemented
1. **Compound Miter Saw Simulation**
   - 360-degree miter angle control (turntable/gauge)
   - 180-degree bevel angle control (hemispherical gauge)
   - Visual blade representation (200" x 12" x 1/16")
   - Laser line for cut alignment
   - CSG boolean operations for actual cutting

2. **Camera System**
   - True orthographic top-down view
   - Perspective mode with full 3D rotation
   - B view (blade profile) for bevel visualization
   - Proper zoom controls tied to user preferences
   - Camera state persistence between views

3. **Visual Controls**
   - Large turntable control (3x original size)
   - Clear degree markings (0° on right, proper rotation)
   - Needle indicators for both miter and bevel
   - Visual blade that rotates and tilts with controls
   - Laser line showing cut path

4. **Physics & Realism**
   - Gravity system (boards fall to table)
   - Blade pivots from ground plane (Y=0)
   - Proper compound rotation using quaternions
   - Accurate CSG cutting with separators

### Technical Challenges Solved

#### 1. Blade Alignment Issues
**Problem**: Blade wasn't perpendicular to laser line, causing incorrect cuts
**Solution**: 
- Made blade 200" wide x 12" tall x 1/16" thick rectangular box
- Aligned blade rotation with laser rotation
- Used clone for CSG to preserve visible blade state

#### 2. Compound Rotation Mathematics
**Problem**: Combining miter (Y) and bevel (X) rotations incorrectly
**Solution**:
```javascript
// Create rotation quaternions
const miterQuat = BABYLON.Quaternion.RotationAxis(BABYLON.Axis.Y, this.bladeAngle);
const bevelRadians = (90 - this.bevelAngle) * Math.PI / 180;
const bevelQuat = BABYLON.Quaternion.RotationAxis(BABYLON.Axis.X, -bevelRadians);
// Combine: miter first, then bevel
const combinedQuat = miterQuat.multiply(bevelQuat);
```

#### 3. CSG Cutting Failures
**Problem**: CSG operations failing with undefined bounds, creating clones instead of cuts
**Solutions**:
- Fixed BoundingInfo API usage (maximum/minimum not max/min)
- Converted quaternions to Euler angles for CSG compatibility
- Properly positioned separators with compound rotations
- Set blade pivot at ground plane using setPivotMatrix

#### 4. Camera and View Issues
**Problem**: Camera wouldn't achieve true top-down view, aspect ratio issues
**Solutions**:
- Forced beta=0 for true orthographic view
- Fixed aspect ratio calculations
- Separated orthographic/perspective projection handling
- Added proper view transitions

## Key Code Sections

### Blade Creation and Positioning
```javascript
// Create blade with proper dimensions
this.blade = BABYLON.MeshBuilder.CreateBox('blade', {
    width: 200,    // 200 inches wide
    height: 12,    // 12 inches tall
    depth: 0.0625  // 1/16 inch thick
}, this.millScene);

// Set pivot at bottom edge for realistic rotation
this.blade.setPivotMatrix(BABYLON.Matrix.Translation(0, -6, 0));
this.blade.position.y = 0;  // Pivot at ground level
```

### CSG Cutting Operation
```javascript
executeCSGCut() {
    // Clone blade for cutting
    const blade = this.blade.clone('csgBlade');
    
    // Apply compound rotation
    blade.rotation = new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 0, 0);
    const miterQuat = BABYLON.Quaternion.RotationAxis(BABYLON.Axis.Y, this.bladeAngle);
    const bevelQuat = BABYLON.Quaternion.RotationAxis(BABYLON.Axis.X, -bevelRadians);
    const combinedQuat = miterQuat.multiply(bevelQuat);
    
    // Convert to Euler for CSG compatibility
    blade.rotation = combinedQuat.toEulerAngles();
    
    // Perform CSG operations...
}
```

## Future Vision: Training Sandbox for Compound Cuts

### Educational Value
The Mill serves as a risk-free training environment where woodworkers can:
- Practice compound miter cuts for crown molding
- Learn proper angle calculations for inside/outside corners
- Experiment with different wood orientations
- Perfect cuts before using expensive materials

### Planned Enhancements
1. **Cut Quality Feedback**
   - Angle accuracy scoring
   - Gap analysis for joints
   - Suggestions for improvement

2. **Material Library Integration**
   - Different wood types affect cutting
   - Grain direction visualization
   - Cost calculations for practice vs. real cuts

3. **Project Templates**
   - Crown molding presets
   - Picture frame calculations
   - Trim packages for rooms

4. **AR/VR Support**
   - Virtual reality cutting practice
   - Augmented reality overlay on real saws
   - Haptic feedback for blade resistance

## Integration with Business Model

## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. Blade render order (should appear in front of board)
2. No rotation snapping with shift override
3. Right toolbar needs replacement with left toolbar style
4. CSG operations slow with complex geometry

### Performance Optimizations Needed
- Level of detail (LOD) for blade mesh
- Caching of common cut angles
- Web worker for CSG operations
- GPU acceleration for physics

## Testing Scenarios

### Compound Miter Test Cases
