========================
We had to terminate our last session prematurely

His dishonesty in the last session was upsetting. 

However, before I did, I took steps to save the compacted version  of our conversation. 

It can be found in this local directory "/home/edgrimaldi/cutlist-project/docs/"

The file name is compact.md. Please review this first.

Also, please review ABoardIsABoard.md. Please review this second.

Also, please review PART_ARCHITECTURE.md. Please review this third.

Also, I asked your to write a summary of what we were working on and where. That can be found in that same directory in the session_summary.md file. Please review this fourth.

Also read CLAUDE.md

After you have reviewed all that, please review my code based and tell me where you think we should pick up where we left off. 

***** Keep in mind that we are working directly on our AWS server via ssh.*****

========================



Do not begin doing anything. I'm very discourage by the results of trying to implement a router solution, and cannot afford any more attempts. So I just want to remark away everything related to it. Don't delete, just make it go away. It makes me sad.



We need to wrap up this session. I have to log off and do some other things, but I want to return later to continue our work on the textures. Would you please take a moment and write a very thorough update for our session_summary.md file. I'm also going to save our conversation's compact file. Between both, I'm hoping we can pick up where we left off. It will be YOU reading this, so be as clear as you think you'll need to find it. Make sure you give yourself a heads up on where the code is, and what we about to work on. If you don't see a session_summary.md, please create one. And remember, this will what you get when I return so your essentially, telling your future self where to start and why.
