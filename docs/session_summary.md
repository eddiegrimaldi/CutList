# Session Summary - December 18, 2024

## CRITICAL: READ THIS FIRST - YOU ARE CLAUDE CONTINUING THIS SESSION

### Current State - CUTTING SYSTEM STILL BROKEN
The cutting system has TWO major issues that I (previous Claude) failed to fix despite multiple attempts:

1. **Piece Positioning Issue**: After cutting, pieces are placed "quite deliberately side by side" instead of end-to-end for cross-cuts
2. **Dimension Display Issue**: All cut pieces show dimensions of "2 31/32" x 2 31/32"" which is half the 6" width minus kerf - NOT the correct piece lengths

**User's Last Words**: "Nothing changed in this iteration either. I believe you are on the wrong track."

## What We Tried (And Failed)

### Attempted Fixes That DIDN'T WORK:
1. **Fixed camera animation** - This actually WORKED! User confirmed: "Holy crap, my friend. You did it. In one try."
2. **Fixed cutting execution** - Cutting now executes, but positioning is wrong
3. **Multiple positioning fixes** - Changed positioning calculations several times, no improvement
4. **Dimension calculation fixes** - Forced use of partData.dimensions, still showing wrong values

### Files Modified:
- `/var/www/html/modules/CutToolSystem.js` - Main cutting logic (heavily modified, has debug logging)
- `/var/www/html/drawing-world.js` - Fixed camera animation (WORKING)

## The Real Problem (My Analysis)

I think I was fixing the wrong thing. The user said pieces are "side by side" when they should be "end to end". For a cross-cut:
- Expected: Two pieces positioned along Z-axis (length), touching with only kerf gap
- Actual: Two pieces positioned incorrectly, showing wrong dimensions

The dimension issue (2 31/32") suggests the system is using WIDTH (6" / 2 - kerf = ~2.96875" = 2 31/32") instead of LENGTH for cross-cut pieces.

## Code Locations

### Server Access:
```bash
ssh -i ~/cutlist-key-2.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-87-50-202.compute-1.amazonaws.com
cd /var/www/html
```

### Key Files:
- **CutToolSystem.js**: `/var/www/html/modules/CutToolSystem.js`
  - Line ~1950-1980: executeCut dimension calculation
  - Line ~2010-2040: piece1Data and piece2Data dimension assignment
  - Line ~2190-2260: Piece positioning logic
  - Has debug logging added (search for "DEBUG" and "CRITICAL DEBUG")

- **drawing-world.js**: `/var/www/html/drawing-world.js`
  - Camera animation fixes (WORKING - don't break this!)

### Debug Logging Added:
Multiple console.log statements added to track:
- Cut direction (cross vs rip)
- Dimensions being used
- Piece sizes before/after kerf
- Positioning calculations

## What Needs Investigation

1. **Why are dimensions wrong?**
   - Check if `piece1SizeInches` and `piece2SizeInches` are calculated from wrong dimension
   - Verify `this.activeCutDirection` is set correctly
   - Check if board rotation affects dimension retrieval

2. **Why is positioning wrong?**
   - The user emphasized: "You need 16 corners to make 2 boards. all 16 are already given to you"
   - Maybe we should use the existing mesh bounds more directly?
   - Check if the coordinate system is being transformed incorrectly

## Next Session Plan

### IMMEDIATE: Texture Work
User wants to work on textures next. From previous session_summary.md:
- Materials system partially working
- Textures being loaded but may not persist correctly
- Material library at `/var/www/html/MaterialsLibrary.js`
- Check texture paths and caching mechanism

### LATER: Fix Cutting (If Time)
If we return to cutting issues:
1. Start fresh - read the actual values being calculated in browser console
2. Check if board rotation affects the issue
3. Consider using mesh bounds directly as user suggested
4. Test with non-rotated board first, then rotated

## Project Context

### Core Principles:
- **"A Board Is A Board"**: Single source of truth for all board data
- **Part Architecture**: Every change should update Part instance immediately
- **Never use SED**: Always use Python for file modifications
- **Test yourself**: Don't ask user to test, check it yourself first

### User Context:
- User is Eddie (edgrimaldi)
- This project is critical for his livelihood
- He's frustrated with the cutting issues after many attempts
- Prefers when we test ourselves before reporting

### Working Environment:
- Development on AWS server as ubuntu user
- Testing with browser cache disabled
- Application URL: http://54.87.50.202/workspace.php

## Commands for Quick Start

```bash
# Connect to server
ssh -i ~/cutlist-key-2.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-87-50-202.compute-1.amazonaws.com

# Check cutting system file
grep -n "CRITICAL DEBUG" /var/www/html/modules/CutToolSystem.js

# Remove debug logging (when fixed)
python3 /tmp/remove_debug.py  # (create this script)

# Test the application
curl -s http://localhost/workspace.php | grep -c 'script src'
```

## WARNING FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **DON'T** break the camera animation - it's working!
2. **DON'T** use sed - use Python scripts
3. **DO** read browser console output to understand actual values
4. **DO** test with simple cases first (non-rotated boards)
5. **REMEMBER** user said we're "on the wrong track" with current approach

## Final Notes

The cutting system issues have persisted through multiple fix attempts. The user's feedback suggests the fundamental approach to fixing positioning/dimensions is wrong. Consider:
- Maybe the issue is in mesh creation, not positioning?
- Maybe dimensions are being swapped somewhere else?
- Maybe the UI is displaying different data than what's actually stored?

When returning, start by investigating what's ACTUALLY happening in the browser console with the debug logging, rather than assuming where the problem is.
