# CutList Project - Session Summary

## Project Overview
CutList is a web-based CAD application for woodworking projects, designed to emulate Shapr3D functionality. It allows users to create 2D sketches and extrude them into 3D models for woodworking planning.

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Babylon.js for 3D rendering
- **Backend**: PHP for page routing
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for project data
- **Deployment**: Files uploaded to www.kettlebread.com/cutlist/ via FTP

## Key Files
- `index.php` - Main dashboard with project management
- `workspace.php` - 3D workspace interface
- `app.js` - Dashboard functionality and project management
- `drawing-world.js` - Main 3D engine with Babylon.js (PRIMARY FOCUS)
- `styles.css` - Dashboard styling
- `workspace.css` - Workspace styling

## Current Status: Sketch Drawing Implementation Failed

### Previous Success
The camera/grid snapping issue was initially resolved in a previous session:
- Fixed camera beta angle for Y-axis (top view) from `0/π` to `π/2/-π/2`
- Grid displayed correctly as a flat grid
- Basic sketch mode was working

### Attempted Implementation
Tried to implement sketch drawing functionality with the following features:
- Drawing tools (line, rectangle, circle, ellipse, polygon, triangle)
- Visual preview during drawing
- Closed geometry detection
- Click-drag support for rectangles

### Critical Failures
1. **Initial Implementation Issues**:
   - Drawing didn't work at all initially
   - Mouse picking failed on invisible sketch ground
   - Coordinate transformation problems caused lines to appear offset

2. **Progressive Degradation**:
   - Each fix introduced new problems
   - Grid started morphing/snapping when switching sketch planes
   - Universal coordinate system implementation made grid disappear entirely
   - Final state: sketch mode completely broken

3. **Root Causes**:
   - Fundamental misunderstanding of Babylon.js orthographic camera behavior
   - Issues with picking on invisible meshes
   - Camera animation fighting with orthographic mode
   - Render loop interference with camera settings
   - Over-engineering solutions instead of keeping them simple

### Technical Debt
- Multiple partially-implemented approaches in the code
- Excessive console logging added for debugging
- Mix of 3D tubes and 2D lines for drawing
- Complicated coordinate transformation system that doesn't work

## What's Broken
- ❌ Sketch plane selection causes grid to morph/disappear
- ❌ Drawing functionality non-functional
- ❌ Universal sketch plane system causes complete failure
- ❌ Camera positioning unreliable
- ❌ Grid rendering inconsistent

## Lessons Learned
- Claimed "deep understanding" of Babylon.js was inaccurate
- Should have started with simpler, proven approaches
- Animation and complex transformations introduced instability
- Each iteration made the problem worse rather than better

## Next Steps (for different developer)
1. Revert to a known working state
2. Implement simple, direct sketch plane creation without animation
3. Use visible picking planes with proper transparency
4. Keep coordinate systems simple and axis-aligned where possible
5. Test thoroughly before adding complexity

## Cost Impact
- $100+ spent on failed implementation
- No working sketch functionality delivered
- System in worse state than at start of session

*Last Updated: Session ended in failure - sketch drawing completely broken*
