# CutList Session Summary - 2025-01-09 (Part 2)

## CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION

YOU ARE READING THIS AS CLAUDE IN A NEW SESSION. User wants to work on TEXTURES next.

### WORKING ENVIRONMENT
- ALL WORK ON AWS SERVER: ssh -i ~/cutlist-key-2.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-87-50-202.compute-1.amazonaws.com
- Files at: /var/www/html/
- Test at: http://54.87.50.202/workspace.php
- Current branch: feature/transform-rotation
- NEVER USE SED - causes escape issues

## WHERE WE LEFT OFF

### Fixed Today:
1. GIZMO CONFUSION - Now using ONLY Babylon GizmoManager (removed custom gizmos)
2. LOADING SPINNER - Fixed with scene.executeWhenReady() instead of timeout
3. PHANTOM BOARDS - Eliminated duplicate creation during project load

### Still Broken (from previous session):
1. Transform display not appearing during drag
2. Move tool position may not persist

### NEXT PRIORITY: TEXTURE WORK
User said: I want to return later to continue our work on the textures

## KEY CODE LOCATIONS

drawing-world.js:
- Line 8819: getMaterialColor() - texture loading function
- Line 10172: clearAllParts() - fixed mesh filtering
- Line 10202: rebuildWorkBenchParts() - fixed spinner timing
- Line 8852: switchBench() - removed duplicate assembly creation

## TEXTURE STARTING POINTS

1. Check getMaterialColor() implementation (line 8819)
2. Review materials-database.json structure
3. Test texture quality and persistence
4. Investigate async texture loading issues

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. ALWAYS check syntax: node --check drawing-world.js
2. Fix backslash errors: perl -pi -e 's/\\\!/\!/g' drawing-world.js
3. We use GizmoManager ONLY - no custom gizmos
4. User is tired of syntax errors - check before testing\!

Session ended positively: You did a great job today, buddy
