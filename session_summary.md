# Session Summary - CutToolSystem Part Integration Fixes

## âœ… MAJOR PROGRESS: Fixed Core Part System Integration Issues

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Mouse interaction conflict** - Cut tool clicks now work instead of triggering part dragging
2. **getPartData method** - Now works with Part objects (mesh.partInstance) 
3. **Preview positioning** - createColoredPreviewPieces uses Part position data
4. **Cut line calculation** - calculateCutLine uses Part position data  
5. **Camera animation** - Uses Part position and rotation with proper transformation matrix

### Current Status: TESTING REQUIRED
The cut tool should now:
- Show previews when hovering over rotated boards
- Position camera correctly for rotated boards  
- Use Part position data as single source of truth
- Handle mouse clicks for cutting operations

### Remaining Issues:
- Need to test actual cutting functionality after preview fixes
- Need to verify cut pieces stay in place with kerf gap
- Need to verify camera animation rotation handling works correctly

### Key Files Modified:
-  - Added cut tool check to prevent pointer conflicts
-  - Fixed all methods to use Part data

### Next Steps:
1. Test if previews now show for rotated boards
2. Test if camera animates to correct position  
3. Test actual cutting functionality
4. Fix any remaining Part system integration issues

User feedback needed on current functionality.
